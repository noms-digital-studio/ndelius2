        remorse differs from any inability to show remorse. Is the offender aware of the impact on the victim?</p>

        motivations, financial gains or addictions? What level of premeditation or planning was involved? Are there
        any patterns suggesting likelihood of similar offending?</p>
    <p class="margin-top">Is there any evidence of discrimination in their attitude or behaviour? Is the offender’s
        maturity an issue in this offence - are they easily led or influenced by a peer group?</p>
